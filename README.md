# Statistics and Data Science
This repsository contains three notebooks outlining a complete modelling process from statistical analysis, data preprocessing and model building. It is intended to display my understanding of the core learning outcomes of the modules:
- Statistics [STAT H1003](https://www.tudublin.ie/study/modules/stat-h1003-statistics/)
- Data Adminastration and Analysis [DATA H2001](https://www.tudublin.ie/study/modules/data-h2001-data-administration-and-analysis/)
- Logic and Problem Solving [LOGC H3001](https://www.tudublin.ie/study/modules/logc-h3001-logic-and-problem-solving/)

## Actor Critic Model ([Actor_Critic.ipynb](Actor_Critic.ipynb))
This model etc 

## Statistical Analysis ([Statistical_Analysis.ipynb](Statistical_Analysis.ipynb))
This outlines 

## Data Preprocessing ([Data_Preprocessing.ipynb](Data_Preprocessing.ipynb))
